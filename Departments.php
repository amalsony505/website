                      <p class="card-text"><b>The Department of Mathematics</b> commenced functioning in 1925 with the introduction of Group I at the Intermediate level with a single faculty: Prof. V.A. Mahalinga Iyer, followed by Prof. M.T. Kurian who was appointed in 1926. The Mathematics section became a full-fledged department in the year 1928 with the introduction of the B.A Mathematics. Prof.T. A. Satagopan MA from Madras Christian College took charge as the Head. Prof. P.C. Joseph (1939-1946) joined the Department later and guided the destinies of the Department with firmness and flexibility. Prof. Satagopan and Prof. P.C. Joseph left the Department to take up work elsewhere. When Prof. M.T. Kurian retired in 1962, Prof. O.C. Kuriakose took over as the Head. During his tenure as Head, in 1965, MSc Mathematics programme commenced. After his retirement in 1978, the mantle of the Head of the Department fell on Prof. S. Abraham. After his retirement in 1991 Prof. M.A. Manuel, M. Prof. M.Venkataraman, Prof M C Varghese, Prof. G. Jayarajan, Prof. Raju V Kuttickal, Dr. Joseph Mathews, Prof Antony Mathew, Dr Rajan K, Prof Zacharia Varkey presided over the Department in turn. The other renowned faculty of the department includes Prof M C Joseph, Prof V S Varkey, Prof K S Venkitachalam Iyer, Prof K E Paulose, Prof T Jacob Mathew, Prof V A Sebastian and Prof K J Joseph. Our journey to centenary is headed by Dr Antony Mathews. The Department celebrated it Navathi in the academic year 2017-18. It is a research center in Mathematics under Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam.</p>

                      <p class="card-text"><b>Our Research Activities</b>
                        Our great professors Prof. T A Satagopan, Prof P C Joseph, Prof O C Kuriakose and Prof S Abraham were gifted teachers with research aptitude.
                        Prof T A Satagopan was instrumental in making a hand written copy of Ramanujan’s Note Books and sending them to the famous mathematician G H Hardy (Ref: Ramanujan: Letters and Commentary, AMS).
                        Throughout his teaching career Prof P C Joseph was immersed in exploring new vistas of knowledge. One of his research papers was published in the prestigious journal, American Mathematical Monthly. He was one of the founding members of Kerala Mathematical Association.
                        Prof O C Kuriakose belongs to a class of his own. As a scholar and teacher of Mathematics, he has few parallels. He has his own philosophy of Mathematics. His speeches and writings are erudite discourses which open up new vistas of mathematical knowledge.
                        Prof S. Abraham is a living legend, who has given notable contributions to statistics. He authored several books on Mathematical Economics, Statistics and Genetics. He was also the president of K M A.
                        Later a major contribution to the field of Mathematics research was given by Prof V A Sebastian in the area of Functional Theoretical Algebra. He also studied vector spaces of continuous curves and introduced a concept called n-curving. He has published 4 research papers and a book entitled “Book of Beautiful Curves”.</p>
